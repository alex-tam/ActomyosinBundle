The generic version of the simulation code provided in this repository has been tested using Julia 1.12.1. Run the code by executing the file "main.jl", and the parameters that can be adjusted are available in "model_parameters.jl". The folder "Simulations_TurnoverRate" contains results (.csv files and figures) for simulations with different turnover models and turnover rates. Ten simulations for each turnover model and turnover rate are included.
